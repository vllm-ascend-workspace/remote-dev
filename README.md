# Remote Developer Substrate

`.remote-dev/` makes remote development feel like local development for Codex,
Claude Code, and other MCP-capable agents. Local work should still use native
Read/Edit/Write/Bash/Glob/Grep/apply_patch tools. Remote work should use the
matching remote companion tools and only add endpoint fields.

The task facade adds `vaws_session`, `vaws_run`, `vaws_execution`, and
`vaws_finish` to the same portable MCP server for Claude Code, Grok, Kimi Code,
Codex and Cursor when the client's native hook, workspace trust and MCP
approval are active. A native-session hook supplies local task context; new
native sessions create new VAWS tasks and resume retains the old task. These
are lifecycle contracts, not evidence that every client has loaded or approved
them. The four tools hide runtime checkout, parity and supervised execution
behind the agent's intent. Local tools and local task identity require no
remote resources.
See [native lifecycle setup](../.agents/coordinator/README.md#task-and-native-session-lifecycle).
Existing `remote_*` names and endpoint semantics remain unchanged. Native hook
acceptance must be checked separately from schema/transport compatibility; a
Bash/CLI fallback, configuration-only result, or pending client approval is
not a native MCP pass.

Default endpoint fields:

- `host`
- `port`
- `user`, default `root`
- `root`, default `/` (full remote path permissions by default)
- `cwd`, default `/vllm-workspace`

Primary tools:

- `remote.read`
- `remote.write`
- `remote.edit`
- `remote.multi_edit`
- `remote.bash`
- `remote.glob`
- `remote.grep`
- `remote.ls`
- `remote.monitor`
- `remote.apply_patch`
- `remote.job_status`
- `remote.job_tail`
- `remote.job_stop`
- `remote.artifact_manifest`
- `remote.artifact_pull`
- `remote.artifact_push`
- `remote.context_snapshot`
- `remote.probe`

The MCP server is `.remote-dev/mcp/server.py`. CLI fallbacks live under
`.remote-dev/tools/` and return a JSON object with a human-readable `text`
field and `remote-dev.result.v1` metadata in `result`. The MCP server supports
standard stdio `Content-Length` framing and a newline-delimited JSON-RPC fallback
for simple tests.

The names above are canonical dispatcher/result names. MCP discovery advertises
portable underscore names such as `remote_read`; dotted calls remain accepted.
See [client compatibility](CLIENT_COMPATIBILITY.md) for Kimi, Claude, Codex,
Cursor, and Grok configuration and version-specific verification.

MCP resources expose endpoint state and generated evidence:

- `remote://endpoints`
- `remote://endpoint/<endpoint-id>/context/latest`
- `remote://endpoint/<endpoint-id>/jobs`
- `remote://endpoint/<endpoint-id>/job/<job-id>/status`
- `remote://endpoint/<endpoint-id>/job/<job-id>/stdout`
- `remote://endpoint/<endpoint-id>/job/<job-id>/stderr`
- `remote://endpoint/<endpoint-id>/artifacts`
- `remote://endpoint/<endpoint-id>/artifacts/<artifact-id>/manifest`

Runtime state is local and untracked under `.remote-dev/state/`. Endpoint alias
files are:

- `.remote-dev/endpoints.json` for team-safe aliases with no secrets.
- `.remote-dev/endpoints.local.json` for local aliases and ignored state.

Managed VAWS `session_id`, `session_file`, and `machine` resolution remain
available as compatibility modes. Host plus port is the default remote-dev
surface.

When no endpoint target is supplied at all, tools auto-bind to the session of
the nearest worktree binding (walking upward from the cwd to a directory with
`.vaws-local/current-session.json`). Inside a session worktree, `remote.bash`
and friends therefore need zero endpoint arguments.

Routing rule for quick verification: running a command, reading a file, or
checking state on the remote container is a zero-sync operation — use
`remote.bash` / `remote.read` / `remote.grep` directly. Never route "run one
command remotely" through remote-code-parity; parity is only for making the
remote code tree match local edits before execution.

Remote read ledgers are scoped by `client_context_id` when supplied, then by
`CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`, `CODEX_SESSION_ID`, `CODEX_RUN_ID`, and
`REMOTE_DEV_SESSION_ID`. The MCP server sets `REMOTE_DEV_SESSION_ID` to a
process-local value on startup, so MCP clients do not need to pass
`client_context_id` explicitly. CLI fallback calls without a client/session id
use the default scope. Ledgers are used as optimistic concurrency checks when
available; they are not required for default edit/write permission.

Model-visible output is capped. Full command logs and job output are exposed
through result refs and MCP resources instead of being copied into tool text.

Claude Code skill shims are generated from `.agents/skills`:

```bash
python3 .remote-dev/tools/sync_claude_skills.py
python3 .remote-dev/tools/sync_claude_skills.py --check
```

Scaffold validation is available as one JSON-reporting entry point:

```bash
python3 .remote-dev/tools/validate_remote_dev_scaffold.py --local-only
python3 .remote-dev/tools/validate_remote_dev_scaffold.py --host 192.0.2.11 --port 46000 --root /vllm-workspace --cwd /vllm-workspace
python3 .remote-dev/tools/validate_remote_dev_scaffold.py --session-id <session-id> --root /vllm-workspace --cwd /vllm-workspace --skip-local
```

The validator runs local contract gates, reports MCP/CLI burden metrics, and can
exercise a live endpoint or session with remote read/edit/write/bash/search,
patch, artifacts, jobs, MCP resources, and parallel scratch workers.
